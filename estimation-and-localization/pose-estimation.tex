\chapter{Pose estimation}

Pose is defined as the position and orientation of an \gls{agent} (a system
with a controller). The plant usually includes the pose in its state vector.
We'll cover several methods for estimating an agent's pose from local
measurements such as encoders and gyroscope heading.
